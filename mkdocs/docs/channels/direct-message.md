# Direct Message Channel

A Direct Message Channel is automatically created when you send a message to the Mr.Prog bot.  This channel allows you to download and upload customization files. It also helps prevent spamming the [#general](general.md) channel with everyone's [customize](../commands/customize.md) commands.

## Recognized Commands

The following commands are recognized in the Direct Message Channel:

* [customize](../commands/customize.md)
* [save](../commands/save.md)
* [load](../commands/load.md)
* [stats](../commands/stats.md)
* [use](../commands/use.md)
* [help](../commands/help.md)
* [display](../commands/display.md)
* [hey](../commands/hey.md)
* [jack](../commands/jack.md)

## Situation Responses

In addition to responding to recognized commands, Mr.Prog will also use Direct Messages for the following situations:

* Responding to you using the help command in another channel
* Telling you that you need admin/mod privileges for a given command
* Alerting you when your navi's online status changes (such as when you go offline/away/busy)
