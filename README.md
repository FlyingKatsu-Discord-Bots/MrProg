# Mr. Prog
A Discord bot themed for MMBN fans (or anyone who wants a bot friend)

* [Video Demo](https://youtu.be/6LBBi2Ay8aY)
* [Documentation and Help Guide](https://warped2713.github.io/mrprog/)
* [Discord Test Server](https://discord.gg/An86Wxy)

## Installation
Mr. Prog is built with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), so if you'd like to run a copy locally, you should `npm install` inside of the **mrprog** directory so you can get all of the dependencies.
```
cd path/to/mrprog
npm install
```
The **package.json** file includes the following dependencies:
* [discordJS](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/) for integrating with Discord
    * [bufferutil]() for faster websockets
    * [erlpack]() for much faster websockets
    * [node-opus]() for audio support
    * [libsodium-wrappers]() for faster voice packet en/decryption
* [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) for file handling
* [moment-timezone]() for time formatting
* [pm2]() for monitoring uptime

## Variations and Reskinning
Mr.Prog bot's configuration files can be duplicated and modified to fit your tastes.  By default, the bot lets you create and interact with _NetNavi_ partners, but you can use the configuration files to use different terminology, character presets, and images.

### Examples might include:
* Super Smash Bros
* Digimon
* Medabots
* Your custom roleplay characters


When the bot gets to version 0.5.0 (with basic battle and item features), I'll include links to these sample variations, so stay tuned!
